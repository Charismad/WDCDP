                        I started Wilbur Daniel Custom Design and Printing (WDCDP) because I have a passion for graphic design. I have an Associates degree in Commercial Art and Advertising. God also first and foremost has gifted me with talent and skills to do this business.
                        Over the past 30 years, I have been sharpening my skills as a graphics artist.

                    I have had the honor of assisting Wilbur Daniel of WDCDP for the past 7 years. I enjoy assisting him at job sites and helping with applications of vinyl graphics. I love watching Wilbur Daniel bring people's buisness ideas to life.
